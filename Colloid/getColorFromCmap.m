%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GETCOLORFROMCMAP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose: get a linearly spaced set of color containing n colors based on
% an existing (char, e.g. jet,hot,...) or inputed colormap (as n x 3
% RGB matrix). This is aimed to be used for plotting multiple graphs on the
% same plot having always differen colors that all belong to a consistent
% colormap.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INPUT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% -- cMap - a colormap provided either as a char (matlab existing one,
% see 'doc colormap' for an exhaustive list) or a list of RGB colors in the
% format n x3,
%
% -- n    - the number of linearly spaced color needed 

function colors = getColorFromCmap(cMap,n)
